This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to type coercion.  The code in `bug.js` shows that adding a number and a string results in string concatenation instead of numerical addition. This is a consequence of JavaScript's flexible type system. The solution in `bugSolution.js` provides ways to avoid this unexpected behavior.  Understanding type coercion is crucial for writing robust and predictable JavaScript code.
